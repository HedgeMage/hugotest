Music production. The production of music. The place many young aspiring musicians haven’t taken into account. Listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FYCVdQrOYM)
Alright, do you think he got that background beat with just his voice? Do you think he got those pitch mods with his voice? 
I think not. Thirty Seconds to Mars did an amazing job on the vocals. But, Illenium, the producer of this song, decided to head to the studio with 30M, and opened up some software programs. For Illenium, that would be Lennar Sylenth1, and FL studio. With countless hours of work, he fine-tuned 30M’s vocals, and added background music to it. Listen to the [background audio.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWVTzJY0xT0) Now, what do you think? If that background audio hadn’t been there, would you have liked the song? Beats are everything. Beats aren’t just the drums. The beats are the music. What does a producer do? Mixing, mastering, and publishing.
Mixing is balancing the track using EQ’s, volume balancers, fading, reverbs, and much more in order to give it a smooth and balanced sound, instead of being excessively loud or too soft. Mastering is enhancing the current sound. Like fine-tuning it, and preparing it for release. Now, time for publishing. Professional music producers usually work for record labels. Songs are released via the record labels. Music producers get in touch with the label, and get their song on various streaming platforms, all interconnected in some way or the other. In the end, your song will go on there if it’s your work, and you pay the licensing fees. So, what do you think? Do you think that you could make a hit track? Produce it? I think you could.
